# Risk Management
Risk management is a detailed process of identifying factors that could damage or disclose assets, in other words evaluating the cost benefit of protecting an asset or not.
Risk management is primarily the responsibility of upper management, but typically done by IT and security. Once an inventory of threats and assets is done, then each pairing must be evaluated.There are two primary risk assessment methodologies:

* Qualitative risk analysis is more scenario based. 

* Quantitative methods result in concrete probability indications or a numeric indication of relative risk. The major steps are:
    * **Assign Asset Value (AV)**
    * Calculate **Exposure Factor (EF)**. Percentage of loss or potential loss  if a specific asset were violated by  a realized risk.
    * Calculate **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**. The potential loss associated with a single realized threat against a specific asset (SLE = AV * EF)
    * Assess the **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**. Expected frequency with which a specific threat or risk will occur.
    * Derive the **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**. Possible yearly loss.
    * Perform cost/benefit analysis of countermeasures

### Risk responses
There are several risk responses to a risk:
* Mitigation or reduction
* Assignment or transfer
* Deterrence
* Avoidance
* Acceptance
* Reject or ignore

### Risk controls
The following are different types of risk control:
* **Preventive**: to thwart or stop unwanted or unauthorized activity
* **Deterrent**:  discourage security policy violations
* **Detective**:  deployed to discover or detect unwanted or unauthorized activity
* **Compensating**: deployed to provide various options to another existing controls
* **Corrective**: modifies the environment to return systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthorized activity
* **Recovery**: are an extension of corrective controls but have more advance or complex abilities
* **Directive**: direct, confine or control actions of subjects to force compliance with security policy
