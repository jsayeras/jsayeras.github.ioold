## Physical Security

### Static Electricity
* Up to 20000v permant circuit damage 17000v+
* Rooms between 59-86F / 15-32C

### Fire Extinguishers
* A Common combustibles (water, soda acid)
* B Liquids (Co2, halon, etc.)
* C Electrical (Co2, halon, etc.)
* D Metal (Dry powder)
* K Cooking media (Alkaline mixtures)

### Fire Detection
* **Rate-of-rise detection** Detect the speed at which the temperature changes reache specific level. Can be fooled by HVAC during winter.
* **Flame-actuated** Based on the infrared energy. Fast and reliable but expensive
* **Smoke-actuated**. Photoelectric or radiactive ionization sensors. Intended to be triggered by smoke but dust and steam can trigger the alarm.
* **Incipient smoke detection** Detect the chemicals associated with early stages of fire. Even more costly than flame-actuated.

### Water Supression Systems
* Wet pipe (always full of water)
* Dry pipe (contains compressed gas)
* Preaction system is variation of the dry pipe which has two-stage detection and release mechanism. It is the best for environments with computers & humans
* Deluge system uses larger pipes and therefore delivers more water.

### Gas Discharge Systems
* Should not be used in environments with people
